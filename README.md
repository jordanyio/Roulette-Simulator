# Roulette-Simulator

This code simulates playing roulette by generating random numbers and calculating the resulting color and category. 
It also keeps track of the money value based on the bets placed on the color and category. 
The simulation runs for 5000 spins and the results are written to a CSV file.

The CSV file is then read and a rolling average of the money value is calculated and plotted in a line chart. 
The x-axis represents the number of spins and the y-axis represents the money value. 
The chart also includes a moving average line to smooth out the data.
